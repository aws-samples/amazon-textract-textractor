    "# Using Textract OCR\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only want to use the Amazon Textract OCR engine, you have to choose between the synchronous `DetectDocumentText` API and the asynchronous `StartDocumentTextDetection` API. The former will block until the OCR inference completes, while the latter will return a `job_id` that you can use to get the results later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, install the `amazon-textract-textractor` package using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install amazon-textract-textractor`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various sets of dependencies available to tailor your installation to your use case. The base package will have sensible default, but you may want to install the PDF extra dependencies if your workflow uses PDFs with `pip install amazon-textract-textractor[pdfium]`. You can read more on extra dependencies [in the documentation](https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-textract-textractor/installation.html)"

A solution to this problem is to use the asynchronous API, which creates jobs and results that you can fetch later. The input file needs to be inside an S3 bucket. If you only have it locally you can provide an `s3_upload_path` and Textractor will take care of upload the file to that directory before calling Textract."
